# Auto Daddy - User Documentation

## Overview

Auto Daddy is a desktop application for generating ASMR daddy audio content using Google's AI technology. The tool allows you to either manually write scripts or have them automatically generated by AI, then convert those scripts into soothing audio using Google's multi-speaker voice synthesis.

## Features

- **AI Script Generation**: Create ASMR daddy scripts with customizable themes and lengths
- **Manual Script Input**: Write your own scripts with proper formatting
- **Voice Selection**: Choose from multiple voice options for audio synthesis
- **Script Saving**: Save generated or manually created scripts for future use
- **Audio Generation**: Convert scripts to high-quality audio files
- **User-Friendly Interface**: Easy-to-use PyQt-based desktop interface

## Requirements

- Python 3.8 or higher
- Google Gemini API key
- PyQt5
- Internet connection for API access

## Installation

1. Ensure Python 3.8+ is installed on your system
2. Install required dependencies:
   ```
   pip install google-genai PyQt5
   ```
3. Set your Google Gemini API key as an environment variable:
   ```
   # On Windows
   set GEMINI_API_KEY=your_api_key_here
   
   # On macOS/Linux
   export GEMINI_API_KEY=your_api_key_here
   ```
   Alternatively, you can enter your API key when prompted by the application.

## Usage

### Starting the Application

Run the application by executing:
```
python ui.py
```

### Generating Scripts with AI

1. Select "AI Script Generation" (default)
2. Enter a theme (e.g., "bedtime relaxation", "comfort after a long day")
3. Select desired script length (Short, Medium, Long, Very Long)
4. Click "Generate Script"
5. Review and edit the generated script if needed

### Creating Scripts Manually

1. Select "Manual Script Input"
2. Enter your script in the text area
   - The application will automatically format your text with "Speaker 1:" prefixes if needed
3. Review and edit as needed

### Generating Audio

1. Select your preferred voice from the dropdown menu
2. Click "Generate Audio"
3. Wait for the audio generation to complete
4. The application will show the path where the audio file is saved
5. You can choose to open the file directly or access it later from the output folder

### Managing Files

- Click "Save Script" to save the current script to a text file
- Click "Open Output Folder" to access all generated files

## Customization Options

- **Script Length**: Choose from Short (~150 words), Medium (~300 words), Long (~600 words), or Very Long (~1000 words)
- **Voice Selection**: Select from multiple voice options with different tonal qualities
- **Theme**: Specify any theme or scenario for AI script generation

## Troubleshooting

- **API Key Issues**: Ensure your Gemini API key is valid and has access to the required models
- **Generation Errors**: If script or audio generation fails, check your internet connection and try again
- **UI Not Responding**: For long generations, the progress bar will indicate that the application is working

## Technical Details

Auto Daddy uses Google's Gemini 2.5 Flash Preview for text generation and the multi-speaker API for audio synthesis. The application is built with a modular architecture that separates text generation, audio synthesis, and the user interface.

## Privacy and Data Usage

- Scripts and audio are generated and saved locally on your device
- API requests are sent to Google's servers for processing
- No data is stored on remote servers beyond what is required for API processing
